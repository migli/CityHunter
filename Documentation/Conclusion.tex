\section{Future Work}

There are clearly some limitations inside of our application and aspects which could be improved. Creating static shared preferences for each challenge and mystery is not a long term solution. We like the idea of saving the user related data as shared preferences. However, it is not so trivial to create shared preferences on the run and creating shared preferences for each challenge and mystery also seems a bit of an overhead, but due to the timing constraints we couldn't elaborate a better solution than just creating static shared preferences. Furthermore, we decided to use JSON as data format for the persistent data, because we wanted to have the future possibility to update the cities, challenges and mysteries easily over the network from a server. A final improvement would also be creating more different types of challenges, so not only question challenges or compass challenges, but also challenges which maybe make use of the camera of the device.
