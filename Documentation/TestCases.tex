\chapter{Test Cases}

In this chapter we will provide 2 test cases describing the steps to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item run successfully through all challenges and get the hint to the mystery.
	\item run unsuccessfully through several challenges and see the different states of the challenges.
\end{enumerate}
The correct answers and the number of tries will be shown between brackets in the test case descriptions.

In order to simulate a run through the city we used ``mock locations''. Hence it is important to tick the ``\emph{Allow Mock Locations}'' in the developer options of your device.\\
Furthermore, we only use mock locations in the Mystery Map Activity. A click on a route button, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:routeButtons}, will automatically launch a thread which will feed the location service of the device with the location points of the direction. In order to avoid inconsistencies on the map, no new thread will be started when another one is still running.
